# **✴️ The Saekarim**

*“One who bears within.”*

---

## **🌱 Origins and Nature**

* **Definition:** The *Saekarim* are a rare sub-population of the Esharim, born with a **paracognitive gland** that accumulates and amplifies **resonant memory pressure**.

* **Birth Frequency:** \~1 in every 360,000 Esharim births.  
* 90% produce offering, 10% do not.

* **Biological Sex:** They are female, though culturally they are seen as a **sacred caste** rather than a gender.

* **Necessity of the Offering:** Without ritual release, the gland ruptures around the age of 28, causing death.

  ## **World totals**

* **Total living Saekarim (all types):** \~6,700

  * **Producers (active now or formerly active):** **6,000** → all are temple-bound

    * **Active (28–110; require release):** **4,200**

    * **Orikari (111–300; self-circulating, no release needed):** **1,800**

  * **Silent (non-producing; never awaken):** **\~700** → may live outside the Covenant; no Vessel needed

Small tweak from earlier: Orikari survival is \~**42–45%**; it yields **1,800** Orikari to make the temple math click.

## **Temple system (12 Great Temples; 12 Vessels)**

Each temple houses **exactly those who ever needed a Vessel** (active \+ formerly active):

**Per temple roster (500 producers):**

* **\~350 Active** (28–110; on the cycle)

* **\~150 Orikari** (111–300; elders, ceremonial, no cycle)

**Planet-wide (×12):**

* **Active \= 12 × 350 \= 4,200**

* **Orikari \= 12 × 150 \= 1,800**

* **Total producers in temples \= 6,000** (covers everyone who ever needed a Vessel)

**Silents (\~700)** live wherever they wish (temple service, shrines, civic life). They do **not** require a Vessel, so they don’t affect capacity.

## **Feeding rhythm (works with a single Vessel per 350 Active)**

* **Comfort cadence:** every **7 days**

* **Strain:** day **10**

* **Critical:** day **14** (Shi-Vellin may stretch to \~19, but it’s agony)

**Vessel’s day (4 sessions \= “meals”):**

1. **Relief chorus A** (≈6–7 Saekarim)

2. **Relief chorus B** (≈6–7)

3. **Relief chorus C** (≈6–7)

4. **Full Offering** (1 Saekari at empathic peak)

That’s **\~19–22 Saekarim/day**.  
 Across **14 days**:

* 56 sessions × \~6 in relief ≈ **336** relieved

  * **14** Full Offerings (those 14 individuals are also counted as relieved)  
     \= **\~350** covered within the 14-day window → the whole active cohort for that temple.

## **🔬 Physiology**

* **Height:** 2.6–2.9m (taller than average Esharim).

* **Skin:** Biochromatic layers — hues vary from lavender and plum (temple-born) to muted blues and green-gold (nomads).

* **Eyes:** Multi-lensed, shimmering, adapted for bright F2-class starlight.

* **Voice:** Multi-tonal resonance; many Saekarim can chant *two notes at once*.

* **The Paracognitive Gland:**

  * Located beneath sternum or throat base.

  * Stores not only personal memory-resonance, but inherited echoes from the living and the dead.

  * Produces the **Offering**: a bioluminescent fluid/mist containing concentrated resonance.  
  * The more full the gland, the more empathic

* **The Offering:**

  * Known in Eshariin tongue as **Yash-kael** — “life poured outward.”

  * Must be received through the mouth of a genetically resonant Vessel.

  * If spilled or left unreceived, it destabilizes into psychic debris or poisons the Saekari internally.

## **🌗 Lifecycle**

1. **Shaelari (“Awakened Throat,” 0–6):** Early mimicry, emotional sensitivity.  
   1. Saekarim are identified via birth-crystal resonance  
   2. Family units raise them, but under spiritual observation  
   3. A priestess visits the home once a month to begin exposure to saekari resonance, just chanting, touchless sound harmonization  
        
2. **Shaevin (“First Stirring” Early Formation (6–18):**

   1. They attend school with regular children but are taught supplemental courses in bio-discipline, breath work, *oral dictation techniques*, and concentration

   2. They are taught to understand their future—not feared, but prepared

3. **Shaevaar (“The Filling,” 18–28):** 

**Pre-Offering Stage**

1. A unique decade. They can:

   1. Explore careers

      2. Travel the galaxy

      3. Fall in love

      4. Have sex

   2. They are **encouraged** to experience—but warned: “*You must return with your mouth unforgotten.*”

4. **Saekari (28–110):** Active phase. Daily Offerings required. This is the **prime of service.**  
   1. **Luma’kari (28-35):** Newly awakened, volatile

5. **Orikari (110+):** Gland inverts, self-contained. Elders who no longer need draining but sometimes Offer in ritual.  
   1. They may retire, mentor, or continue Offering

   2. Many become **Silent Blessings**—elders who roam the gardens, speaking wisdom, offering only during high ceremonies

## **🤲 Cultural Note: “The Return”**

That pre-Offering decade (18–28) is incredibly romanticized.

Some saekarim **go rogue**, become soldiers, mercenaries, erotic performers, even pirates—but most return. There’s a whole genre of song on Eshariin called **“Returning Hymns”**: stories of wayward saekarim who’ve seen galaxies but come home dripping, longing, to kneel at the Temple gates, offer gland pulsing, begging to join the Covenant.

When one returns, it is called **“The Weeping of the Glands.”**  
 There’s always a ceremony. Always a first draining. Always tears.

## **🧬 Caste Types**

* **Saekari (Active):** Fully offering, temple-bound priestesses.

* **Luma’kari (“Dawn-Bearers”):** Newly awakened, volatile, extremely potent.

* **Orikari (“She Who Sings Without Exhaling”):** Retired elders, revered.

* **Kari’Lah (“The unburdened”):** Born with dormant glands; respected but non-producing.  
  * don't necesarily want anything to do with the covenant. they might, but some see it as a relief that they don't have to bare the burden, and some see it as unfulfilled potential

## **🫀 Empathic Resonance**

* The fuller a Saekari’s gland, the **stronger her empathic ability.**

* **Sweet spot:** When nearly full but not yet painful, a Saekari can sense the emotions and tensions of others with exquisite precision — making her an unmatched **therapist, counselor, negotiator, or diplomat.**

* **Pain threshold:** When the gland becomes overfull, the ability tips into danger — visions, seizures, and unstable resonance storms. Some Saekarim deliberately **tread this line**, risking themselves to sharpen their insight for the sake of their people.

* **Cultural role:** This gift makes Saekarim essential to **justice, mediation, and governance**. Judges and peace-brokers are often Saekarim, who can absorb the resonance of disputes and render a verdict that feels undeniable.

* **Respect:** Because their empathic gifts keep Eshariin peaceful and whole, Saekarim are not only needed for survival but also **deeply revered** as guardians of harmony.

  ---

  ## **🛐 Social Role**

* **Sacred Icons:** Saekarim live apart in temples, but their influence is planetary.

* **Custodians of Memory:** They carry what others cannot — both blessing and burden.

* **Dependence on Vessels:** Without Vessels to relieve their burden, the Saekarim’s empathic gifts collapse into suffering. This makes the Vessel role **existentially central** to all of Eshariin.

  ---

  ## **⚠️ Risks and Dangers**

* **Resonance Overpressure:** Without release, Saekarim suffer migraines, fever, seizures, and eventual rupture.

* **Breaching:** Spillage of unreceived Offering — dangerous and wasteful.

* **Shi-Vellin:** Emergency trance technique to loop resonance internally. Painful; survivable for \~5 days.

  ---

  ## **✨ Religious / Mythic Dimension**

* The Covenant teaches:

   *“We do not remember because we want to. We remember because the Star does not drink enough.”*

* The Saekarim are not just vessels of survival — they are **the conscience of Eshariin.**

* Their empathic resonance is seen as a divine gift, balanced by the divine curse of overpressure.

  ---

  ## **🎭 Narrative Significance**

* To the Esharim, losing 500 Saekarim isn’t just tragedy — it’s the collapse of diplomacy, justice, and social order.

* This makes **Venari’s plea to Calen** nearly unbearable: she is asking him not only to save lives, but to preserve the very balance of her world — while standing before Lina, who sees the same act as erasure of the man she loves.Venari is in Shi’vellin at the time, and can feel both of their pain.
