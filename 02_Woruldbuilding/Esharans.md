## **The People of Eshariin (Non-Saekari)**

### **Species Overview**

* **Name:** *Esharim* (the general species; *Saekarim* are a rare subset)

* **Physiology:**

  * Tall and light-boned due to 0.8g gravity; average height \~2.6–2.8m

  * Skin tones: deep velvet brown, opalescent gray, muted indigo; some regional variation

  * Eyes: large, multi-lensed, shimmering, adapted to filter constant bright-blue F2 starlight

  * Voices: resonant and multi-tonal, often producing harmonics when chanting

  * Mouths: slightly wider than human norm; in some versions with a split upper palate for resonance

  * Lifespan: Most Esharim live to around 230, but Orikari can live upto 300, the oldest was 312 when she died.

### **Social & Cultural Structure**

* **Civilizations:**

  * 12 major civilizations across continents, each autonomous but joined by the Covenant.

  * Population \~2.4 billion; lightly populated relative to resources.

* **Daily Rhythm:**

  * The 30.8-hour day is divided into **four pulses** (meals, rituals, sleep, Offering cycles).

  * Time and society are synchronized with this rhythm, meaning the whole culture has a **slow, steady, harmonic cadence** to daily life.

* **Religion & Reverence:**

  * Most Esharim are not Saekarim, but the Saekarim are **sacred icons**.

  * Ordinary people rarely, if ever, enter temple grounds. Temples are **separate but central** — everyone knows of them, but few interact directly.

  * Pilgrims sometimes journey across seas/highlands just to glimpse temples from a distance.

* **Attitudes toward Covenant:**

  * Many Esharim view the Covenant as noble and holy.

  * Some resent it, seeing it as cultic, outdated, or too powerful.

  * Despite dissent, no one jokes about or openly disrespects the Saekarim — their survival is too central to planetary life.

### **Roles of Ordinary Esharim**

* **In Temples:**

  * Non-Saekarim serve as *healers, acolytes, archivists, attendants, vocal instructors, gardeners, builders*.

  * They maintain the infrastructure but do not directly participate in the Offering.

* **In Society:**

  * Farmers, traders, scholars, artists, and diplomats.

  * Diplomacy is explicitly handled by non-Saekarim so that Saekarim remain spiritually apart from politics.

  * Cultural production: Esharim art, song, sculpture, and liturgy are famous across the galaxy — especially erotic but non-violent works.

### **Cultural Traits**

* **Memory Resonance (literary draft only):**

  * On Eshariin, *memory is contagious* — a low-level resonance shared among people. Most manage it fine; only Saekarim are overwhelmed.

  * Ordinary Esharim thus live with a subtle psychic bleed-through of one another’s experiences, making them deeply communal, empathetic, and cautious with speech and silence.

* **Appearance & Aesthetic:**

  * Their height and harmonic voices are seen as *holy aesthetics*.

  * The closer one’s body “reaches to the stars” (i.e., height), the more reverence attached.

✅ **So in short:**  
 The **Esharim people** are a tall, resonant, artistic, politically neutral civilization spread across 12 semi-autonomous cultures, bound together by reverence for the Saekarim and the Covenant. They live slow, rhythm-driven lives shaped by the four pulses of their long day, and most never interact directly with the Saekarim, but their entire civilization orbits around ensuring the Offering cycle continues.
