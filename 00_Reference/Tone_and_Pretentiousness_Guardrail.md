# 🧭 Tone & Pretentiousness Guardrail
**for The Vessel and the Temple of Thirsting Light**  
*(Refer to this during drafting and editing)*

---

### 1️⃣ Show, Don’t Announce
- Check each paragraph: is the theme *shown* through image, action, or dialogue rather than *stated*?
- Swap sentences that explain ideas for sensory or emotional equivalents.  
  > ✗ “Calen understood the futility of duty.”  
  > ✓ “He tightened the strap again, knowing it would loosen before dawn.”

---

### 2️⃣ Emotion Before Abstraction
- Lead with the feeling, not the concept.  
  > ✗ “Duty is a paradox.”  
  > ✓ “He hated that saving her meant killing the rest.”

---

### 3️⃣ Keep Language Transparent
- When a line sounds “beautiful,” ask if it *serves clarity or calls attention to itself.*
- Allow one or two ornate sentences per page; surround them with clean, muscular prose.

---

### 4️⃣ Human Moments Are Sacred
- Give the reader dirt, sweat, humour, awkwardness.  
- Let someone interrupt a ceremony, spill a bowl, make a small joke.  Trivial details keep gravity believable.

---

### 5️⃣ Earn the Big Lines
- Reserve grand, aphoristic statements for **turning points**—when a character *has paid* for the right to say them.
- A maxim dropped too early reads as authorial showing-off; after suffering, it reads as truth.

---

### 6️⃣ Balance Awe with Tenderness
- Awe without tenderness feels pompous; tenderness without awe feels flat.
- Each chapter should contain at least one of each.

---

### 7️⃣ Silence Is Allowed
- You don’t have to fill every gap with significance.  
- Sometimes a gesture or a pause carries more weight than a paragraph of exposition.

---

### 8️⃣ Let the Reader Finish the Thought
- End on resonance, not resolution.  
- If you can remove the last line of a passage and the meaning still hums, stop there.

---

### 9️⃣ Re-read as the Opposite of You
- After drafting, re-read once as a cynical reader: “Would I roll my eyes here?”  
- Then re-read as a compassionate one: “Do I feel this person’s pain?”  
If both selves are satisfied, the tone is right.

---

### 10️⃣ When in Doubt, Understate
- Understatement feels confident.  Over-explanation feels anxious.  
- Let the story whisper what you could have shouted.

*To be used by Neil during drafting and by Ada during proofreading and stylistic review to ensure tone remains earnest and emotionally grounded, not pretentious.*
