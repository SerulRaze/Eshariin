# I. THE WORLD

## Planet: Eshariin

# Eshariin is an Earthlike world orbiting a pale blue star. Its gravity is slightly heavier than Earth's, and its rotation is longer: a full solar day is 30.8 hours, traditionally divided into four pulses that regulate daily rituals, sleep, nourishment, and *the Offering.*

# Its continents are home to twelve major civilizations, each governed autonomously but joined by *The Covenant*‚Äîa global agreement that maintains harmony and memory stability via *the Temple System.*

# What sets Eshariin apart from all other known worlds is not its landscape, climate, or even its technology. It is the resonant phenomenon inherent to all its people:

# On Eshariin, memory is contagious.  Not through speech. Not through writing.  Through *resonance.*

# Memory echoes in the neurochemical fields of the living and the dead.  Most citizens manage this low-level resonance without issue.

# But in rare individuals, the burden becomes unbearable.

# ---

# II. THE SAEKARIM

## Biology

# The Saekarim are biologically female born with a rare neural-lymphatic mutation. This mutation results in the growth of a *paracognitive gland*‚Äîan organ that stores and refines resonant memory pressure.

# It‚Äôs not memory in the traditional sense‚Äînot facts or timelines‚Äîbut the imprint of experience:

* # Grief that was never spoken 

* # Joy that was never sung 

* # Fear that outlived its owner 

# As they age, the Saekarim accumulate not only their own emotions, but the inherited resonance of centuries‚Äîsometimes millennia‚Äîof cultural experience.

# This begins around puberty, and accelerates over time.  By 28, without intervention, the paracognitive gland ruptures.  Death follows within hours.

# *‚ÄúShe remembers too much. And there is nowhere else to put it.‚Äù*

# ---

## The Offering

# To survive, the Saekarim perform a sacred ritual known as The Offering:

* # The gland swells under pressure, often accompanied by *a faint internal hum or warmth in the chest* 

* # The Saekari assumes breath posture and initiates exhalation 

* # From the hollow at the base of her throat, a *stream of hyperconcentrated neurochemical mist* is released 

# This Offering cannot be allowed to disperse.  If not received directly, the vapor becomes unstable within seconds, fracturing into random mnemonic debris that poisons both the air and the minds of nearby individuals.

# *The Offering must be taken whole. Inhaled. Swallowed. Stabilized.*  And only one class of person can do it.

# ---

# III. THE VESSELS

## Biological Capacity

# Vessels are a *genetically rare human subtype* capable of absorbing the Offering safely.

# Their physiology features:

* # Hyper-dense neural-membrane lattices in the throat and lungs 

* # Specialized oral mucosa capable of converting mnemonic vapor to stable protein traces 

* # A distributed storage pathway that houses received memory *non-consciously*‚Äînever overwhelming the identity of the Vessel 

# They cannot recall what they receive.

# But they *feel* it.

# And in subtle, subconscious ways, they *become conduits of the Saekari‚Äôs presence.*

# ---

## Function

* # A Vessel kneels before a Saekari 

* # He opens his mouth and lungs 

* # He receives her Offering 

* # He swallows it. 

* # She forgets. 

* # He becomes. 

# This exchange is performed four times daily, aligned with the planetary rhythm of the Quarter Pulse.

# The Vessel requires no food.  No sleep beyond brief cycles.  The Offering sustains him.

# He is not *honored*.  He is *used*.  But he is revered for *what he allows others to become*.

# ---

# IV. THE TEMPLES OF THE MOUTH

# Twelve great Temples span the globe, each housing:

* # \~500 Saekarim requiring active Offering 

* # 1 Vessel, known formally as *The Mouth of Memory* 

* # Countless servants, ritualists, breath priests, and scholars 

# Temples are built around *resonance harmony*: acoustics, breath pathways, pressure release, and ritual architecture.

## Design

* # Arched vaults that amplify vocal tone 

* # Pillars shaped like tongues and tastebuds 

* # Stone mouths carved into the walls that *echo Saekari breath* 

* # Sacred gates shaped like lips, closed until a full choir breathes in unison 

# The Temple is not a place of worship.  It is a pressure chamber.  A living lung.  And the Vessel is its *single exhale valve.*

# ---

# V. HISTORY & MYTH

## The First Vessel

# Before the Covenant, Saekarim perished young.  They were gifted, radiant, doomed.  Until one named Selenuth lay dying, her Offering building to a fatal crescendo.

# A mute boy, unnamed, approached her.  And without being told, *opened his mouth.*

# She breathed out.  He breathed in.  And when it was done, she lived.

# He did not speak.  But from that day forward, *he was filled with her.*

# The Saekarim called him *Mouth.*  And built the first Temple around his body.

# ---

# VI. SOCIETAL ROLE & REVERENCE

### The Saekarim

# They are not rulers.  But they are *respected as custodians of the emotional continuity of civilization.*

# They serve as:

* # Historians and diplomats 

* # Composers of Breath Canticles 

* # Resonance judges (resolving disputes by absorbing memory and rendering verdict) 

# They are honored, but not envied.  Few survive past 80 without trauma.

# Some, at 110+, enter the Orikari phase: an age where the paracognitive gland folds inward, allowing them to circulate Offering within themselves. These are the *elder sages*, though many become silent or dream-locked.

# ---

### The Vessels

# Only twelve active Vessels live at any time.  They do not speak publicly.  They do not travel.  They do not marry.

# They are kept within Temple walls, maintained in a state of *openness*.

# Most do not survive more than 200 years.  Some last only 50\.  Many become *soft-voiced echoes of the Saekari they‚Äôve served.*

# ---

# VII. DAILY LIFE & RHYTHM

# Time on Eshariin is governed by the Quarter Pulse: four divisions of the day, each marked by:

1. # The Rising Breath (dawn) 

2. # The Midvoice (early afternoon) 

3. # The Descending (sunset) 

4. # The Silent Chamber (night) 

# Each Pulse includes:

* # Public memory-drain ceremonies 

* # Prayer-hums 

* # One *private Offering* between each Saekari and the Vessel 

# This rhythm regulates Saekarim survival.  No more than five days may pass between full drainings.  Beyond that, the Saekari must enter Shi-Vellin‚Äîa meditative state where Offering is looped internally.

# Shi-Vellin is difficult to sustain.  After three days, gland strain begins.  After six, rupture is inevitable.

# ---

# VIII. THE CRISIS PROTOCOLS

### The Genetic Codex

# Rarely, a Temple Vessel is lost‚Äîaccident, madness, death.  When no trained Vessel can be found, the Temple initiates Crisis Protocol 1-A: Codex Invocation.

# This summons an *archived genetic Vessel*‚Äîa being grown and maintained in stasis, designed solely to absorb Offering at *critical volumes*.

# These beings are not raised normally.  They are awakened only when hundreds of Saekarim risk death.

# They are sacred.  And feared.

# ---

# IX. THE OFFERING (Expanded)

# The Offering is:

* # Warm 

* # Dense 

* # Sweet-smelling 

* # Colored faintly gold 

* # Meant to be inhaled and swallowed *in silence* 

# Some Vessels describe it as *milk of memory*  Others say it burns.  Most say nothing.

# ‚ÄúShe exhales what she cannot hold.  He takes it in.  And for a moment, her sorrow becomes silence.‚Äù

# ---

# X. NARRATIVE ENTRY POINT

# Your protagonist: a Codex Vessel named Calen.

# Awakened prematurely.  Untrained.  He is sent to the Fifth Temple, whose Vessel has died.  Its 500 Saekarim are approaching rupture.

# Calen must learn to serve them‚Äîfour Offerings a day‚Äî  With no training. No choice.  And a gland count *tilted dangerously toward old age.*

# 

# **üìñ *The Covenant of the Thirsting Star***

### **Expanded Lore Bible ‚Äì Revised Core Canon**

***A prestige-worlded cosmological document***

In the tongue of the Esharim, the word for ‚Äúmouth‚Äù and ‚Äúmemory‚Äù is the same: *sha'al*.  
 To open one is to lose the other.

## **üåç I. THE WORLD: ESHARIIN**

Eshariin orbits a distant orange-white subgiant in a quiet, uncatalogued arm of the galactic veil. Its orbit is eccentric, its tides sluggish, its air heavy with luminous particulate that sings faintly in the high altitudes.

* **Surface gravity:** 0.72g

* **Day length:** 30.8 hours

* **Atmosphere:** Dense, mildly alkaline, rich in neural-reactive trace elements

* **Biome:** Mountainous archipelagos, dense spore-forests, wind-etched highlands

* **Native Species:** ***Esharim*** (sentient), among others

### **Physiological Note:**

The **Esharim** are ***not human***.  
 They are **tall**, **lightboned**, **resonant**, with ***non-symmetric neural lobe structures*** and an unusually developed ***orocranial interface gland***‚Äîa bioelectric organ that resonates not only with other minds but with **ancestral memory fields** buried in the very fabric of the planet.

* Height average: **2.6‚Äì2.8 meters** (Saekarim often taller)

* Skin: Variants of deep velvet brown, opalescent gray, and muted indigo

* Hair: Organic, but **tends toward stylized shapes** due to fine electromuscular tuning

* Mouths: Slightly wider than human norm, with **a split upper palate** allowing resonance absorption and **complex oral tones**

---

## **üî• II. THE THIRSTING STAR AND THE ORAL COVENANT**

### **Historical Cosmotheology**

Before the modern Temple system, before the Vessels, before language coalesced into script, the Esharim lived under a myth:

The sky-star was *thirsting.*  
 It wept resonance into the air.  
 And those who did not ***drink it*** went mad.

From this belief arose the first ***oral rites***‚Äîearly, violent, desperate.  
 They believed ***the breath must be shared.***  
 That ***resonant pressure must be swallowed.***

Over generations, ritual became doctrine. Doctrine became Covenant. And the star‚Äôs thirst became *our own.*

### **Original Name:**

**‚ú∂ *Kuvaz‚Äôlainn Sha‚Äôara* ‚Äî "The Covenant of the Star That Hungers Through Us"**

No accurate translation exists in Trade. The best rendering is:

**The Covenant of the Thirsting Star**

Today, this name refers to both:

* The ***ancient pact*** to protect the Saekarim

* The ***Temple system*** itself

* The ***spiritual alignment*** of memory, Offering, and survival

‚ÄúWe do not remember because we want to.  
 We remember because the Star ***does not drink enough.***‚Äù

## **üëë III. THE SAEKARIM: LIFECYCLE AND BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY**

The **Saekarim** are not a caste.  
 They are **a rare neurological sex**‚Äîexclusive to **feminine-aligned Esharim**, defined by the maturation of the **paracognitive gland**: a resonance-processing organ located just beneath the breastbone.

### **Birth Frequency:**

* Occurs in \~1 of every 10,000 births

* Not genetically predictable

* Often born ***during solar flares or atmospheric disruption events***

---

## **üå± Lifecycle Stages:**

### **1\. Shaelari ‚Äì ‚ÄúAwakened Throat‚Äù (Age 0‚Äì12)**

* No gland activity, though early cognitive symptoms manifest

* Affinity for *oral learning*, mimicry, and harmonic recursion

* Often misdiagnosed as hyperaesthetic or emotionally volatile

### **2\. Shaevin ‚Äì ‚ÄúFirst Stirring‚Äù (12‚Äì21)**

* Gland begins resonating with collective mnemonic fields

* Emotional states deepen toward ***unexplainable grief or joy***

* Early training in ***Pressure Breathing, Memory Containment, Sleep Sealing***

### **3\. Shaevaar ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Filling‚Äù (21‚Äì28)**

* Gland becomes ***bioluminescent under strain***

* Saekari begin ***‚Äúhearing the Offering‚Äù*** in dreams

* Must begin daily exhalation cycles, or risk ***Overpressure Syndrome***

Most Saekarim die at 28 without intervention.  
 **This is when they must enter the Temple.**

---

### **4\. Saekari ‚Äì ‚ÄúShe Who Breathes and Forgets‚Äù (28‚Äì110)**

* Full Offering phase

* Four daily ***controlled exhalations***

* Must be received by a **Vessel**, or redirected through *Shi-Vellin* (dangerous)

* At peak fullness (\~3‚Äì5 hours post-Offering), she may exhibit:

  * **Total emotional recall** of ancestors

  * **Temporary oracular speech**

  * **Muscle tremors and spontaneous hymnal resonance**

---

### **5\. Orikari ‚Äì ‚ÄúShe Who Sings Without Exhaling‚Äù (110+)**

* The gland ***inverts its resonance cycle***, creating a closed loop

* The Saekari becomes ***self-contained***, but at immense psychic cost

* Most become either ***ritual oracles*** or enter ***Echolock*** (a catatonic trance of interior memory recirculation)

Only **5‚Äì6%** survive the transition.  
 But those who do are ***revered beyond the Temple.***  
 They are not touched.  
 They are not spoken to.  
 They simply *hum.*
