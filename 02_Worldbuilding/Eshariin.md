### **Planetary Context**

* **Star Type:** F2-class (hotter, brighter than Sol); pale-blue light

* **Day Length:** 30.8 hours, divided into **four pulses** that regulate meals, rituals, and sleep

* **Gravity:** \~0.8g (slightly lighter than Earth, fostering tall, lean physiologies)

* **Axial Tilt:** Minimal ‚Üí stable climate with little seasonal variation

* **Atmosphere:** Dense, noble gas‚Äìrich, mildly alkaline; luminous particulate at high altitudes that hum faintly, creating an audible *‚Äúsky-song‚Äù* when winds rise

  ### **Continental and Regional Layout**

Eshariin is dominated by **archipelagic supercontinents**: massive landmasses broken into fractured coasts, volcanic ridges, and inland seas. Much of the surface is water, giving rise to maritime cultures and a spiritual association with *breath and tide.*

**Major Biomes:**

* **Mountainous Archipelagos** ‚Äì chains of volcanic islands surrounded by mist-heavy waters. Temples often rise from these isles, visible for miles, their spires built to catch light and sound.

* **Spore-Forests** ‚Äì ancient, dense forests where giant fungal towers release glowing particulate at night. These forests are simultaneously feared and revered; their ‚Äúbreath‚Äù inspired the Saekarim hymns.

* **Highland Plateaus** ‚Äì wind-etched plains with sparse vegetation, known for resonance stones that hum when struck by storms. Pilgrims journey here to ‚Äúhear the voices of the ancestors.‚Äù

* **Orchards & Quiet Seas** ‚Äì cultivated coastal lowlands surrounding many temples, filled with fruiting trees and saltwater pools used in ritual purification.

### **Civilizations**

Global population: \~2.4 billion (Eshariin is **lightly populated, rich in resources, highly sustainable**)

* **Twelve Major Civilizations** form the cultural backbone of the planet, each autonomous but unified under **the Covenant of the Thirsting Star**.

* These civilizations are tied less by borders and more by **temple influence**: each of the twelve great temples sits at the center of an archipelago or plateau, serving as spiritual and cultural capitals.

* Cities cluster around the temple orchards, but ordinary Esharim rarely enter the temple rings themselves.  
* ‚ÄúBirth rate is low, due to **spiritual regulation and emphasis on *quality over quantity***‚Äù

### **Cultural Geography**

* **Neutral Political Alignment:** No standing armies; Eshariin is recognized as a neutral enclave in galactic politics.

* **Spiritual Magnetism:** Pilgrims travel across seas and highlands to glimpse temples from afar; to enter them is a rare honor.

* **Cross-Galactic Influence:** Despite their isolation, Eshariin‚Äôs erotic art, throat-based liturgies, and oral hymns are exported widely ‚Äî a paradoxical mix of seclusion and fascination.

# Eshariin is an Earthlike world orbiting a pale blue star. Its gravity is slightly lighter than Earth's, and its rotation is longer: a full solar day is 30.8 hours, traditionally divided into four pulses that regulate daily rituals, sleep, nourishment, and *the Offering.*

# Its continents are home to twelve major civilizations, each governed autonomously but joined by *The Covenant*‚Äîa global agreement that maintains harmony and memory stability via *the Temple System.*

# What sets Eshariin apart from all other known worlds is not its landscape, climate, or even its technology. It is the resonant phenomenon inherent to all its people:

# On Eshariin, memory is contagious.  Not through speech. Not through writing.  Through *resonance.*

# Memory echoes in the neurochemical fields of the living and the dead.  Most citizens manage this low-level resonance without issue.

# But in rare individuals, the burden becomes unbearable.

üïì Daily Feeding Schedule (Traditional):

1. **Dawnmeal**

2. **Midlight**

3. **Duskwarm**

4. **Starrest**

This 4-meal model becomes the cultural and **ritual backbone** for feeding cycles. Eating \= Offering \= Communion.
