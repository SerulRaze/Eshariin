# The Vessel and the Temple of Thirsting Light  
## Chapter One — The Breaking of the Voice

It began in silence.

Not absence-of-sound silence, but the kind that carried a weight—like a hand pressed gently over the mouth of the world. In the inner rings of the Sixth Temple of Thirsting Light, the Saekarim were failing their breath.

Two days earlier, the Chorus-Mothers had begun the **Shi-Vellin**, the discipline of withholding: fasting, slowed lungs, the careful folding of want into stillness. It was meant to pause the body’s pressure—the accumulation of **Offering**, that bright, unstable resonance their line bore within. It could be borne for a little while. Not for long. And not by so many at once.

Chorus-Mother **Venari** moved through stone corridors veined with pale milklight. She was tall even for her people, bare feet quiet on whisperstone, veiled throat steady. Every inhale she measured, knowing that too deep a breath could provoke a spike—another surge of pressure in those she guided.

She passed a chamber where a newly awakened **Luma’kari** shivered on her pallet, clutching her own ribs as if to keep herself from spilling. A thin thread of light dampened the sheet beneath her—resonance already leaking from the body’s store, unshaped, unused, growing cold.

“Another breach,” Venari murmured.

She pressed her palm to the wall. A low tone traveled the stone—summoning acolytes to gather what could still be kept. Even waste was not permitted to wander; even unreceived Offering was sacred.

At the center of the temple, the **Vessel’s bed** remained folded and pure.

He had died in the fourth watch. No cry. No collapse. The milkstones above his head dimmed, and the little glyph that traced his pulse sighed out. When they found him, his hands were at rest: one over his heart, the other reaching not outward, but inward—as if to steady himself in that last moment of receiving.

Now the temple breathed around an absence. The Offering rose in bodies and could not be carried away. Panic held its breath.

## The Hall of Breaths

The **Grand Lactarion** sat coil-limbed upon the Throne of Inward Light, her age a pale radiance beneath crystal gauze. She was the oldest voice of this temple; her own body had quieted a century ago, but she remembered the burn, the pressure, the ache of not being met. She could feel it now in her daughters—pressure mounting, prayer thinning to a thread.

“We must open the Codex,” she said. Her voice did not echo. It never needed to.

Gasps rose among the **Chorus-Mothers**. Not scandal, exactly. Fear. One spat softly on the stone, a warding.

“That archive was concession and theory,” said **Mother Nirei**. “We swore we would never summon from it.”

“Offworlders do not carry the right breath,” said another. “Their mouths are not tuned to us. They would break.”

“They might poison the cycle,” a third whispered. “What if the resonance unbinds inside them?”

“What if he survives,” someone asked, quieter, “and speaks?”

The Lactarion lifted a hand. “If we do nothing, we lose five hundred. The Luma’kari are already leaking light. None of you will survive a second Shi-Vellin.”

Venari knelt, the motion slow, reverent. “Let me search, Mother. If there is any match, however thin, I will find him. I will tell him the cost.”

The veiled face turned. “You would bring an offworlder here?”

“If he is a Vessel, and he survives the first receiving,” Venari said, “then he was always meant to be here.”

“And if he dies?”

“Then we bury him among the saints.”

## The Codex

The machine was older than the temple—older than the orchards, older than the milkstone itself. It hummed when no one touched it, as if listening to the breath of the planet. Two high priestesses were needed to wake it fully; Venari’s mouth upon the intake stone would be enough to let it look.

She knelt, pressed lips to crystal, and gave the Codex a measured breath.

Light widened across the floor—rings within rings, each line of glyph a path through remembered bodies. Ancestries rose and fell like a tide. On the outer ring: nothing. On the second: a few bright pulses that died as quickly as they came.

On the third ring, a sustained glow.

Venari closed her eyes. The Lactarion’s voice was very soft.

“Bring him. With respect. With sorrow. With speed.”
