# Chapter Three — The Sound That Stays  

The apartment seemed smaller after. The silence between them was no longer comfortable but sharp.  

“You’re not going,” Lina said.  

Calen placed the token on the table. It pulsed once beneath his palm. “They’ll die if I don’t.”  

“They’ll die if you do. Sixty-seven percent? That’s not fate, Calen. That’s a coin toss. And what about *us*? The life we built, the vows we were about to make—doesn’t that count?”  

He looked at her, and every detail struck him with unbearable clarity: the way she tapped her fingers against her glass when she was thinking; the crooked smile that came when she was trying not to laugh; the warmth of her breath when she whispered in her sleep.  

He wanted to choose her.  

But the faces of strangers he had never seen, women in temples far away, pressed at the edge of his thoughts—five hundred lives he could not yet imagine, waiting, suffering.  

“I gave up nothing when I said yes to you,” he whispered. “Now I’m asked to give everything.”  

Her eyes filled but did not spill. “Then don’t make me forgive it.”

a raw, ragged scream, torn from her body as if by force. Not a name. Not a plea. Just the sound of a future shattering.  

He did not turn back.  

The light closed around him.  

And the scream—that was the last human sound he would ever hear.
