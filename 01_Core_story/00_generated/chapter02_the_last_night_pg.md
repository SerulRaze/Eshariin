# Chapter Two — The Last Night  

The apartment was dim but warm, the kind of warmth that lingers between two people who have lived together long enough to share silences without filling them. Lina’s head rested against Calen’s shoulder; his hand traced the line of her arm without thought.  

“Three weeks,” she murmured.  

“Twenty-one days,” he corrected softly.  

She laughed into his chest. “You’re impossible.”  

“Only precise.”  

They were speaking of their wedding. Of the Mars colony where they’d already put down a deposit. Of the future that had seemed, until hours ago, like a line running straight and true.  

He pictured her in the dress she had chosen, the one that had made him forget every coherent word the first time he saw it. He pictured the home they would share—small, light-dappled, with space for books and art and late-night tea.  

They lay there with the steady rhythm of two hearts in time, the world beyond their walls distant and irrelevant.  

For a little while, nothing existed but *us.*

When Calen woke in the dark, there was a heaviness in his skull. He padded quietly to the kitchen, poured water, glanced through the window—and froze.  

Across the rooftop, a figure stood in the rain yet remained untouched by it. White and gold robes shimmered faintly. Her skin was dusk-colored, her eyes reflective as glass. She raised a hand, not in greeting but in summons.  

In the other, she held a crystal disc that pulsed with a rhythm he felt in his bones.  

The glass slipped from his hand. It shattered.  

Lina stirred awake at the sound.

By the time they stepped outside, the envoy had not moved in an hour. Rain slid around her as though refusing to touch her.  

“That’s a Saekari,” Lina whispered, her voice tight with knowledge. “Sixth Temple colors.”  

Calen nodded. He could not explain how he knew she was right.  

The envoy’s voice, when it came, was not a single voice at all but a chorus.  

“Calen Rho. Son of Sol. We come in grief. Our Vessel is gone. The Shi-Vellin has begun. If we are not received, we will perish.”  

Lina’s jaw set. “Why tell us?”  

The envoy’s eyes lingered only on Calen. The disc in her hand flared with glyphs, strands of light weaving into a lattice. In the center: his name.  

**CALEN RHO — COMPATIBILITY 67.1%**  
**RISK: EXTREME**  

Lina stepped back, her face drained of color. “No. He’s not one of you. He’s not trained. You’ve never—never used an offworlder.”  

“No,” the envoy agreed.  

“Then why him?”  

“Because there is no one left.”  

Her voice, layered though it was, broke on the last word.  

Lina turned to Calen, eyes wide, voice cracking: “They’re asking you to die.”  

“We are asking him to try,” the envoy said. She extended a dull stone, inert until breath would wake it. “The portal closes with the sun. If he comes, he comes. If not—we will not ask again.”  

And then she was gone.
