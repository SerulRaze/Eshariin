# Chapter Four — The Math of Mercy

Dawn unstitched the night. The token was cool in his palm, the way a coin is cool just before it remembers who it belongs to.

Lina opened the bedroom door. She wore his old hoodie, sleeves over her hands. Her face was washed clean, not because she had cried, but because she hadn’t.

“You’re really doing it,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

He nodded.

“I hope they are gentle,” she said. “I hope what you carry doesn’t crush you. I hope—” She stopped. Her mouth hardened, and then softened again. “I hope there is a peace in it that I cannot imagine.”

“I’m sorry,” he said.

“Don’t be. You’re choosing five hundred lives over two.” She stepped close, touched his face with both hands as if memorizing it by shape. “I understand. I don’t forgive.”

He closed his eyes, opened them. “I know.”

He took the stairs to the roof. Each step felt like a counted breath. When the token warmed and the **portal** opened—a soft iris of light, soundless—he heard a sound that would follow him for the rest of his life: not his name, not a plea, just a torn, human noise from the doorway behind him; Lina, swallowing a scream with her own hands.

He did not turn back.

The light closed around him like a mouth that had been waiting for exactly this shape.
