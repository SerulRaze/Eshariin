A disturbance rippled through the air around her, pulling at the pain in her throat trying to coax it out. She steadied herself as the wave was followed by a pained, muted cry from a nearby chamber. She knew what had happened, but it was her charge to check, confirm, respond. Carefully still she moved along the corridor, to the chamber that bore the sound, and worse, the chamber from which the light was breaching.

Thessa, a newly awakened Luma’kari, had only been at the temple for three days. She had come, after a fulfilling Shaevaar, to take her place. Venari remembered greeting her. “My Offering is upon me,” she had said dutifully.

Today was to be a joyous day for Thessa, but she lay now in her new chambers clutching at her sternum in agony. The hum here was pure dissonance; it infected the air itself. The air seemed to shiver like illuminated ice crystals dancing in the dark. From her mouth grew a strand of pure white and purple light contorting, reaching out desperately to find someone to bear it. The light condensed like water into luminescent fluid.

“I’m so sorry, Thessa” Venari said, her voice betraying her sadness, as she moved her mouth to the wall panel. “Breach” she whispered, and light traveled accompanied by a low tone through the walls to the acolytes. The memory debris would have to be carefully removed, and stored – even in its most toxic form, it was sacred.

Venari began to weigh more drastic options. Instigate a controlled breach of all those too far along, and an evacuation to the other eleven temples for those still able to travel.

“How has it come to this?” she muttered to herself

“Six millennia without fail…. We knew when Vaelun flooded this may happen, but our hubris looks to be our undoing.”
