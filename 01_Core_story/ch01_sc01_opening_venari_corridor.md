Chapter 1

scene1

It began in silence.

The air was always thick on Eshariin, but these last days you could have choked on it. Chorus Mother Venari walked the temple hallways with care. Every step, every breath measured. The thick air felt like oil on her skin. Despite the situation and her apprehension, she moved with the grace of someone praying through body alone.

She needed the resonance to wane. Had she been earlier in her offer-cycle, she would have willed the invisible hum into submission. It pressed against her throat, trying to negotiate its way out.

For the good of her dying sisters, Venari held her breath close.

Her emotions flattened. Her gaze soft. One false move and twenty-five Saekarim, deep into the Shi-Vellin, could breach.

The hallways were never lively. Now they had been emptied of the ever present hum, it seemed even breathing was sacrilege. These past few days, sound hadn’t just been dampened; it had been commanded out by the Chorus Mothers, and replaced by deep fear and deeper concentration.

A floral calm filled Venari’s senses; she allowed herself the briefest happy memory – meadows on the hills overlooking a bay. The acolytes had been instructed to do whatever they could to calm the senses. She wondered why they had chosen bayflower incense, but didn’t have time to question the thought any further.
